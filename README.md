# local-python
 The python language in Indian Languages

## Purpose
Python is a very versatile language and can be used everywhere. I recently came across an ad of a company which was teaching Python in local languages. So there was a teacher who was teaching the syntax of the Python language in kannada, and I was thinking, "This is nuts! You still have to know English to understand what the keywords mean!" That is when it clicked to me about a python language written in local languages.

This project is still under development. I have no Idea on where to start, how to do. I have done a basic job of replacing occurances, but I am sure, there is more to it!

So, feel free to contribute! Let's make this something nice to learn! Let's show everyone that we can code in any Indian Language!

## Usage

### Creating a local python file.
Create a file using the file extension py```[xx]``` or py```[xxx]```  where ```xx``` or ```xxx``` is the 2 letter and 3 letter ISO Code for the local language respectively.

Example - kannada.pykn, hindi.pyhi

### Writing code in the local language.
The syntax of the local python is same as normal python. Just replace the keywords with the local ones. The local keywords are present in keywords/```[language]```.yml

### Examples
To see some simple examples, check out the examples folder.

### Running the program.
You can run a sample code written in kannada using the following command
```shell
py code.py examples/kannada.pykn
```
