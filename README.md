 The python language in Indian Languages

## Purpose
Python is a very versatile language and can be used everywhere. I recently came across an ad of a company which was teaching Python in local languages. So there was a teacher who was teaching the syntax of the Python language in kannada, and I was thinking, "This is nuts! You still have to know English to understand what the keywords mean!" That is when it clicked to me about a python language written in local languages.

This project is still under development. I have no Idea on where to start, how to do. I have done a basic job of replacing occurances, but I am sure, there is more to it!

So, feel free to contribute! Let's make this something nice to learn! Let's show everyone that we can code in any Indian Language!

## Usage
You can run a sample code written in kannada using the following command
```shell
py code.py kannada examples/kannada.py
```
